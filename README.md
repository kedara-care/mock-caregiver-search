# Mock Caregiver Search

An automated demo showcasing Kedara's AI-powered caregiver search and screening process.

## How to Use

1. Open `chatbot.html` in your browser
2. Ask the bot to find a caregiver for Silvia with experience in memory care, who can visit her twice a week
3. The bot will redirect you to a Care.com-style caregiver search page and automatically:
   - Search for caregivers by care need and zipcode
   - Filter results by hourly rate and condition experience
   - Rank and refine the best matches
   - Open caregiver profiles and conduct automated screening chats
   - Record screening notes
4. Once screening is complete, you'll be redirected back to the chatbot with a scheduled interview confirmation

You can also append `?auto_run=true` to `index.html` to run the caregiver search automation directly.
